The original idea is to filter the comments count to be greater than 1000, and 
keep track of the lowest rating of all books I have crawled, whenever I hit a new 
book record, I compare the rating of it to the lowest rating, and if it's greater than 
the lowest rating in my list, I delete the book with lowest rating and add the new book, else
I continue browsing, at the end of the crawling, I sort the list of books and write the data to excel
